# EDA
Finding a pattern within the features would be impossible. It is better to look at the structure of features and looking at the intervals the line-graphs reside in. For comparing myself i feel that i exhibit the same dynamic style of each DJ, this is probably due to the fact that they have a heavy influence on me and i often try to emulate them.  

## Key takeways
- Kaytranda is the most consistent in keeping danceability througout the whole set (nver falls below 0.6)

- Kaytranada had more tracks with vocals in them, whereas the other DJ's tended to play instrumentals

- Kaytranada played lower tempos, and throughout the set he increases tempo throughout the set. Nia tended to hover more around 140-160 BPMs, this is because of the genre she mixes which is Jungle/ DnB which generally operates around those BPMs. For most DJ's including me, the majority of BPMs lie around 120 - 140 BPMs this is a common tempo for tracks because many believe that it is easy to dance at this tempo (although we see how special Kaytranada is since he tops the DJ's in Danceability)
