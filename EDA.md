# EDA
Finding a pattern within the features would be impossible. It is better to look at the structure of features and looking at the intervals the line-graphs reside in. For comparing myself i feel that i exhibit the same dynamic style of each DJ, this is probably due to the fact that they have a heavy influence on me and i often try to emulate them.  

## Key takeways
- Kaytranda is the most consistent in keeping danceability througout the whole set (nver falls below 0.6)

- Salute + Barry and Nia Archives produced the most energy throughout their sets

- Kaytranada had more tracks with vocals in them, whereas the other DJ's tended to play instrumentals

- Kaytranada played lower tempos, and throughout the set he increases tempo throughout the set. Nia tended to hover more around 140-160 BPMs, this is because of the genre she mixes which is Jungle/ DnB which generally operates around those BPMs. For most DJ's including me, the majority of BPMs lie around 120 - 140 BPMs this is a common tempo for tracks because many believe that it is easy to dance at this tempo (although we see how special Kaytranada is since he tops the DJ's in Danceability)

## Principles (Average Tempo and Key Across Tracks)

### Tempo
- The boxplots below show the average difference in Tempo and Key changes as it goes from track to track throughout the setlist. For tempo we can see that most DJ's  3 out of 5 have small changes as they go from track to track. But for Daftpunk and Nia Archives they tend to have a wider range of tempos to play from, this is most likely due to their mixing styles. For Sammy, we can observe four outliers in the data. This occurrence is most likely due to the fact that he might have been playing tracks at double time. This means he beatmatches a track with a lower BPM to match the other track by doubling it. Referring back to the tempo chart at track 6 (index 5), he was playing a track at around 70 BPM, but in reality, he is beatmatching from the previous track, effectively playing at 140 BPM.
