# Introduction 
This project aims to leverage the Spotify Web API to extract track information from selected DJ playlists. By utilizing the Spotify API, the project retrieves track URIs from playlists belonging to various DJs, facilitating the analysis of audio features across different sets.

The art of DJing involves blending different tracks seamlessly, creating a continuous flow of music that captivates listeners and keeps them energized and entertained.
Mixing, the core activity of a DJ, involves transitioning between songs, manipulating sound elements, and blending tracks together harmoniously. DJs utilize equipment such as turntables, CDJs, mixers, and software to manipulate tempo, rhythm, and tone, allowing for smooth transitions and creative expression. Mixing is not just about playing songs in succession; it's about crafting a narrative through music, understanding crowd dynamics, and tailoring the set to suit the atmosphere and preferences of the audience.

## Mixing

To choose songs, a primary technique DJs use is called beatmatching. This involves adjusting the tempo of one track to match the other track. In the graphic above, the second track "Foundation" is originally created at a tempo of 135 BPM (Beats per minute). A DJ typically presses the cue button (the headphone button) to preview the track in his headphones and adjusts the tempo accordingly. They then have control over the song's lows, mids, and highs, and it is up to them to blend the two tracks together seamlessly, they can also blend tracks together with the use of effects (seen on the top left)

To ensure a seamless and musically pleasing mix, DJs often employ harmonic mixing, a technique rooted in music theory. Harmonic mixing involves selecting and blending tracks that share compatible musical keys or harmonies. When tracks are in the same or complementary keys, they tend to blend together more harmoniously, creating smoother transitions and maintaining the overall coherence of the mix. In harmonic mixing, DJs typically aim to keep their transitions within a range of -3 to +3 semitones, either up or down. This range allows for flexibility in selecting tracks while ensuring that the harmonic relationship between them remains intact. Moving within this range enables DJs to transition smoothly between tracks without causing dissonance or clashing harmonies. In the grahpic the key is shown by '3m' and '2m' under the track. (This could differ from DJ software - I use traktor software)

Although it is good practice to follow these principles, a good DJ typically finds creative ways to break them while still maintaining musical coherence and engaging the audience. This ability to deviate from traditional mixing techniques allows DJs to experiment with unexpected combinations of tracks, explore new musical avenues, and inject their sets with unique flair and personality
