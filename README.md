# Introduction 
This project aims to leverage the Spotify Web API to extract track information from selected DJ playlists. By utilizing the Spotify API, the project retrieves track URIs from playlists belonging to various DJs, facilitating the analysis of audio features across different sets.

The art of DJing involves blending different tracks seamlessly, creating a continuous flow of music that captivates listeners and keeps them energized and entertained.
Mixing, the core activity of a DJ, involves transitioning between songs, manipulating sound elements, and blending tracks together harmoniously. DJs utilize equipment such as turntables, CDJs, mixers, and software to manipulate tempo, rhythm, and tone, allowing for smooth transitions and creative expression. Mixing is not just about playing songs in succession; it's about crafting a narrative through music, understanding crowd dynamics, and tailoring the set to suit the atmosphere and preferences of the audience.
